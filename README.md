The edu-sharing plugin adds a new block to the Gutenberg-Editor. 
Using the edu-sharing resource allows you to either pick content from the repository or upload it to a folder of the 
repository.

=== Installation ===

After activating the plugin connect it to an edu-sharing repository (settings -> Edusharing).
Then register your wordpress-site in your edu-sharing repository (admin-tools -> applications).

If this fails, you can manually register it in the repository by registering the url `https://example.com/wp-content/plugins/edusharing/metadata.php`

For a full documentation with screenshots of the post installation steps for the edu-sharing plugin visit the [documentation pages](http://docs.edu-sharing.com/confluence/edp/en).
